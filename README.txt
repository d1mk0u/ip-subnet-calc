What it does:
Input any IP address and CIDR notation (with NO / mark) and get information about your subnet. Returns:

Entered IP:
Netmask:
Network:
Useable Hosts:
Broadcast: 

How to use:
You will need Python 2.7 and the default libraries. Double click "ip-subnet-calc", input the IP and CIDR notation.

On Windows, a cmd.exe window will appear, running the code through it. The lines are a way of showing it is still
running and not hung.
